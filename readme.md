Scale invariant feature transform -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform

Full implementation for panorama image construction. Use of image Gaussians, difference of
Gaussians/Laplacian filter, Gradient filter, knn for matching, homography for panorama construction. Invariant to
scale, rotation, affine distortions, change in 3d viewpoint, addition of noise, change in illumination.

"tp3.m" is the starting point of the program.
